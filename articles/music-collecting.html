                <div class="e-content">
                    <p>
                        Last year I write about using
                        <a href="https://ambalek.club/articles/music-home"
                            >music without streaming services</a
                        >, and I've discovered a few more small things since
                        then to do with maintaining a music collection. My
                        current setup is based around a NAS, and I like to copy
                        music to SD cards to play on portable music players, or
                        use Sonos to play through speakers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Better Quality Tags</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, I have no idea why, but legit DRM-free music
                        I've purchased through iTunes, Amazon, and Bandcamp, can
                        have messy tags that confuses music players. The album
                        might show up as duplicated in an "albums" view, or
                        songs and artists aren't named consistently and
                        correctly.
                    </p>
                    <h4>MusicBrainz Picard</h4>
                    <p>
                        One way to fix bad tags is using
                        <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/"
                            >MusicBrainz Picard</a
                        >. The way I like to use it is by dragging in an album
                        at a time, seeing what matches it generates, then
                        selecting the release I think is the correct one.
                        Sometimes a few tracks aren't matched, so I'll drag
                        those ones to the corresponding entry in the release
                        I've chosen, and eventually I get the gold disc icon
                        that means the release is 100% matched.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        width="800px"
                        src="/media/images/brainz.png"
                        alt="Editor"
                    />
                    <p>
                        Saving in Picard will update the files, but it also
                        embeds custom <code>MusicBrainz*</code> tags. Some music
                        players prefer these tags and it helps them better
                        organise music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing I enjoy about this process is seeing what
                        other releases of an album exist, and the different
                        track listings. For rock/metal/etc that usually means
                        live tracks, which can be interesting, but there are
                        rarities included in some releases that are fun to
                        discover. I've even got iTunes and Amazon albums with
                        platform-specific bonus tracks, so it's not unique to
                        physical releases. I think in the streaming era I forgot
                        bands did bonus tracks, and it reminded me of how
                        jealous I was of a friend who had the Japanese
                        <em>The Bends</em> which I think had
                        <em>How Can You Be Sure</em> and <em>Killer Cars</em>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>ReplayGain</h3>
                    <p>
                        Another level of polish you can add to your digital
                        collection is ReplayGain, which is a way to help players
                        <strong>gain match audio files</strong>. ReplayGain
                        works by embedding yet more tags that include gain
                        offsets for audio files. There's an offset for the track
                        itself, and also one for the album. Using the album gain
                        means songs have the correct gain within the context of
                        their album &mdash; the example I read was a ballad
                        still being quiet next to the other songs in the album,
                        to preserve the author's intent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tool I'm using to add RG tags is
                        <a href="https://github.com/complexlogic/rsgain"
                            >rsgain</a
                        >. It's a command-line program, and the way I use it is
                        just <code>rsgain easy /path/to/my/music</code>. It runs
                        recursively, so it'll update the tags of the entire
                        collection in one go. I haven't tried hardware/portable
                        music players with ReplainGain enabled, but my desktop
                        players support it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An additional detail to ReplayGain is peak: the dB
                        offset for a track/album is generated, but it also
                        tracks a value for the album/track peak. This means your
                        player shouldn't play anything too loud and distort, so
                        it feels like a pretty good approach as far as I
                        understand these things.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Music Unknown to Metadata Services</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some of the albums that I've listened to for many years
                        were not matched by MusicBrainz or any other services I
                        tried. The funny thing is they were sold by
                        iTunes/Amazon, so I think the coverage for digital
                        releases isn't 100%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With one particularly stubborn release I had to manually
                        edit the tags. The core problem was it's a compilation,
                        and wasn't tagged that way, and I don't want all of the
                        artist names individually listed in the artist list in
                        my music players. I eventually got the album name edited
                        so it was the same for every file, and set a
                        <strong>compilation</strong> flag, and all was well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For editing tags, I found
                        <a href="https://kid3.kde.org/">Kid3 - Audio Tagger</a>
                        and
                        <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/easytag/"
                            >easytag</a
                        >
                        to work. These sorts of programs usually treat music as
                        folder-based, so you select a folder and they'll parse
                        the id3 tags for each music file in that folder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of these programs are better than others. I found
                        issues with certain tools not showing specific versions
                        of id3tags, or fields I just couldn't surface that I
                        knew were there (and confusing one of my players). The
                        one I found the most friendly and to show the fields I
                        needed to edit reliably was
                        <a href="https://mp3tag.app/">Mp3tag</a>, which I think
                        is only available for macOS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also concocted a ridiculous Python script that added
                        album art to all of my music, but I later found
                        <a href="https://onetagger.github.io/">One Tagger</a>,
                        which might be a safer way of doing that sort of thing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Anyway…</h3>
                    <p>
                        Take a look at tidying your music file tags, and
                        experiment with gain offsets embedded with ReplayGain.
                        It can make your collection feel more coherent and
                        pleasant to explore, and if you're using portable or
                        hardware music players to amp up fancy headphones it's
                        worth it.
