      <p class="p-summary">A photography-inspired ambient/drone album released on whitelabelrecs.</p>

      <div class="e-content">
        <p><a href="https://whitelabrecs.bandcamp.com/album/redscale">Redscale</a> by Braulio Lam is an ambient drone album that's inspired by photography. Slowly unfolding, hazy guitar sounds, occasionally more glitchy or clicking guitar tones (<em>2. Sensitive Emulsion</em>), and fragments of field recordings (<em>6. Canon A-1</em>).</p>
        <p><em>Redscale</em>, overall, has a positive and gently uplifting sensibility, but there are darker moments (<em>7. Skylight Filter</em>).</p>
        <p>Many of <em>Rescale's</em> tracks follow a pattern of sticking to a similar emotional range -- there are no abrupt changes in chord or key. This gives the music a lilting, introspective dimension, but there are flecks of sounds and details that reward repeated listening.</p>
        <p>I've listened to <em>Rescale</em> many times over the last week or so, it has accompanied me on walks, journeys through the city, and during work, and I've found it to be a beautiful companion.</p>
