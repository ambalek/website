    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>Having arbhar present in a eurorack case induces audible noise at the output when it is powered.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the m05 Silencer didn't seem to improve the noise floor.</li>
      <li>Physically moving arbhar outside of the case didn't improve the noise floor.</li>
      <li>A simple subtractive patch included noise when arbhar is powered, even though arbhar wasn't involved in the patch.</li>
      <li>The gain boosting I've used in these tests is loud enough to the point that I believe the noise is typically very low with a correctly gain-staged patch.</li>
      <li>I didn't record this, but as arbhar boots you can hear it go from no noise, to noises that are different to its usual noise, until the Raspberry Pi finishes booting and the noise I've recorded here starts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on these findings I believe that it's extremely important to use correct gain-staging when using arbhar in a patch. If possible arbhar should be housed in a separate case, otherwise all of your patches will have some additional noise even when the module is not used.</p>
    <p>Also, because the noise doesn't seem to significantly change when moving arbhar outside of the case, it seems like it is a case of arbhar introducing noise into the power bus rather than RF interference.</p>

    <h3>Test 3: m05</h3>
    <p>Inaudible patch, arbhar plugged into the same power flying bus power input, physically moved outside of the case, using the <a href="https://trogotronic.com/product/m05/">m05 Silencer</a>.</p>

    <h3>Test 4: Does arbhar interfere with other modules?</h3>
    <p>A subtractive patch is used but the gain is set such that noise is audible when the output is boosted.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Patch</dt>
      <dd>Oscillator through filter, low pass, gain set very low, arbhar present in the rack but not used for audio.</dd>
      <dt>Gain</dt>
      <dd>The input attenuation on the filter was set as low as I could.</dd>
      <dt>Expected sound</dt>
      <dd>The oscillator against a small amount of noise.</dd>
      <dt>Observed sound</dt>
      <dd>More noise than expected.</dd>

    <h3>Test 5</h3>
    <p>The same as test 4, but with arbhar unplugged from the eurorack power board.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Patch</dt>
      <dd>Same as 4 but with arbhar unplugged.</dd>
      <dt>Expected sound</dt>
      <dd>The oscillator against a small amount of noise.</dd>
      <dt>Observed sound</dt>
      <dd>The oscillator against a small amount of noise.</dd>

    </figure>
    <p>The previous test was repeated with the patch fully turned down so the oscillator is barely audible, and this gives the noise that the rack produces without any patch.</p>
