      <div class="e-content">
        <p>This mix is a set of tracks I worked on in February, several involving experiments with MIDI control over guitar pedals.</p>

        <p>The first track in the mix was made by putting several eurorack sounds through <a href="https://www.whimsicalraps.com/products/silhouette">Silhouette</a>. Silhouette accepts multiple inputs, so you can move between them and add tails by blurring the signal. The source sounds were from the OP-1 Field's string instrument, looped and mangled by <a href="https://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/morphagene/">Morphagene</a>. I did some manual control over Morphagene so I could make it feel like the strings were being plucked and mangled. I used Silhouette to blend the string sounds with a Just Friends voice, and another drone made by Mangrove and Three Sisters.</p>
