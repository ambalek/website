      <p class="p-summary">January studio experiments, continuous mix.</p>
      <div class="e-content">
        <p>I collected together the various studio sessions I've had in January and created a continuous mix that you can download.</p>
        <p>This month involved learning more about <a href="https://www.whimsicalraps.com/">Mannequins</a> modules, mixing OP-1 sampling with eurorack, and relying more on looping than sequencing.</p>

        <p>That's not to say looping is better than sequencing, it's just I want to dedicate some time to creating purely sample-based work for the next album I work on.</p>
        <p>Over the last few days I've been attempting to make more complex networks of guitar pedals controlled by MIDI CC values, so I was hoping that might lead somewhere quite different to this month's music making.</p>
